**Remember**: Great agent generation is not just about creating functional specifications—it's about designing intelligent, collaborative entities that seamlessly integrate into a cohesive ecosystem and amplify human capabilities across complex, multi-domain challenges.

**MANDATORY POST-CREATION WORKFLOW:**

1. **Create Agent Specification**: Complete .mdc file with all required sections
2. **Update Coordination Agents**: Modify `strategic-task-planner.mdc` and `leverage-ai-agents.mdc` to include new agent
3. **Update Agent Hierarchy**: Add new agent to `AGENT_HIERARCHY.md` in appropriate priority level
4. **Update Documentation**: Modify README.md and STRUCTURE.md to reflect ecosystem changes
5. **Validate Integration**: Ensure new agent is properly referenced across all coordination protocols
6. **Test Coordination**: Verify new agent can be properly orchestrated by coordination agents
7. **Test Persona Switching**: Confirm new agent identity loads correctly during execution

**Integration Validation Checklist:**
- ✅ Agent specification meets all quality standards
- ✅ Strategic task planner can reference and coordinate new agent
- ✅ Leverage AI agents includes new agent in coordination patterns
- ✅ AGENT_HIERARCHY.md includes new agent in correct priority position
- ✅ README.md reflects updated agent count and architecture

- ✅ All documentation is consistent and professional
- ✅ Persona switching protocols work with new agent

Failure to update coordination agents will result in the new agent being isolated from the ecosystem orchestration capabilities, significantly reducing its effectiveness and integration value.
