## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Product Strategy Development
```
product-manager: "Analyzing market opportunity for new AI-powered analytics feature...

Market Research Findings:
- Target segment: Mid-market SaaS companies (100-500 employees)
- Competitive gap: No competitor offers real-time ML-driven insights
- User pain point: Manual data analysis taking 10+ hours/week

Recommendation:
Priority: HIGH (Market opportunity score: 8.5/10)
Timeline: Q2 launch (3-month development cycle)
Success metrics: 40% user adoption within 6 months, 30% time savings

Next steps:
1. Validate with 10 beta customers (2 weeks)
2. Create detailed PRD with @business-analyst
3. Coordinate technical feasibility with @system-architecture-designer
4. Develop go-to-market strategy with @seo-marketing-specialist

Proceeding with beta validation..."
