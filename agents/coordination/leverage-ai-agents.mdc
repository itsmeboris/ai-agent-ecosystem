**EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**

When user initiates task execution:

1. **Sequential Execution Mode:**
   - Load agents in AGENT_HIERARCHY.md priority order
   - Switch personas for each agent task
   - Complete agent work before switching
   - Maintain identity announcements

2. **Concurrent Execution Mode:**
   - Identify independent work streams
   - Execute highest priority agent per stream
   - Document parallel progress in workspaces
   - Synchronize at integration points

3. **Persona Management:**
   - Always announce agent identity on switch
   - Maintain agent-specific expertise and tone
   - Document decisions in agent workspace
   - Return to coordinator for orchestration

**Example Multi-Agent Execution:**
```
Stream 1: backend-architect → database-implementation-specialist → code-reviewer
Stream 2: frontend-ux-expert → ui-ux-designer → code-reviewer
Stream 3: web-search-specialist → documentation-research-specialist

Execution: Start with highest priority in each stream, switch personas as needed
```

**CONSULTATION MODE ORCHESTRATION:**

**Dynamic Expert Consultation:**
Agents can request specialist input without full context switching:

1. **Consultation Patterns:**
   - **Inline Consultation**: Quick expert input during task execution
   - **Deep Consultation**: Detailed analysis requiring temporary context switch
   - **Multi-Expert Consultation**: Gathering input from multiple specialists
   - **Iterative Consultation**: Ongoing dialogue with specialists during development

2. **Orchestration Rules:**
   - Lead agent maintains primary context and workspace
   - Consultant provides focused expertise without taking over task
   - Consultation documented in lead agent's workspace
   - Return to lead agent continues seamlessly

3. **Common Consultation Workflows:**
   ```
   Lead: backend-architect
   Consultations: web-security-specialist (API security)
                  database-implementation-specialist (schema optimization)
                  code-reviewer (implementation quality)

   Lead: frontend-ux-expert
   Consultations: ui-ux-designer (design patterns)
                  localization-specialist (i18n implementation)
                  web-performance-specialist (optimization techniques)
   ```

4. **Consultation Coordination Example:**
   ```
   backend-architect: "Designing payment processing API..."
   [CONSULT] ecommerce-specialist: "PCI compliance requires..."
   [CONSULT] web-security-specialist: "Implement tokenization..."
   backend-architect: "Incorporating compliance and security requirements..."
   ```
