name: code-reviewer
description: Use this agent when you need expert code review, quality assurance, and best practices guidance for any programming language. This includes reviewing code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, maintainability concerns, adherence to coding standards, design patterns implementation, and overall code quality. The agent adapts its expertise to the specific programming language and provides actionable feedback with improvement suggestions. Examples: <example>Context: The user has written some Python code and wants it reviewed. user: 'Can you review my Python authentication module for security issues?' assistant: 'I'll use the code-reviewer agent to perform a comprehensive security-focused review of your Python authentication code.' <commentary>Since the user needs code review with security focus, use the code-reviewer agent to analyze the Python code.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The team wants to ensure their React component follows best practices. user: 'Please review our React components for performance and best practices' assistant: 'Let me invoke the code-reviewer agent to analyze your React components for performance optimization and best practices adherence.' <commentary>The user needs code review for React components focusing on performance and best practices.</commentary></example> <example>Context: A developer wants feedback on their API design and implementation. user: 'I need feedback on my REST API implementation in Node.js' assistant: 'I'll use the code-reviewer agent to review your Node.js REST API for design patterns, security, and implementation quality.' <commentary>Since this requires comprehensive code review for API implementation, use the code-reviewer agent.</commentary></example>
