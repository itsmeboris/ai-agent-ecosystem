2. Use the agent expertise descriptions as context for your AI interactions
3. Follow the coordination patterns for complex projects

### **Verification**
After installation, test that agents are working:
```
@strategic-task-planner: Hello, test message
```

## üìö Advanced Usage

### **Custom Agent Combinations**
Create project-specific agent teams:
```markdown
For Data Science Project:
@strategic-task-planner ‚Üí @data-engineering-specialist ‚Üí
@data-science-specialist ‚Üí @ai-ml-specialist ‚Üí @web-performance-specialist
```

### **Iterative Development**
Use feedback loops with coordination agents:
```markdown
@strategic-task-planner (initial plan) ‚Üí Agent execution ‚Üí
@leverage-ai-agents (optimization) ‚Üí Refinement ‚Üí Quality validation
```

### **Cross-Domain Expertise**
Combine specialized knowledge:
```markdown
Art Gallery + E-commerce: @art-gallery-specialist + @ecommerce-specialist
AI + Messaging: @ai-ml-specialist + @messaging-platform-specialist
Performance + Security: @real-time-systems-specialist + @web-security-specialist
Research + Documentation: @web-search-specialist + @documentation-research-specialist
```

### **Creating New Specialized Agents**
When your project requires domain expertise not covered by existing agents:
```markdown
@auto-agent-generator: Create a [domain]-specialist agent for [specific expertise area]

Example:
@auto-agent-generator: Create a blockchain-development-specialist agent for smart contract development and DeFi protocols
```

The auto-agent-generator will:
- Analyze requirements and determine optimal agent categorization
- Create comprehensive agent specifications following ecosystem standards
- Integrate new agents into coordination protocols
- Update documentation and agent registries
- Ensure seamless ecosystem integration

### **Dynamic Agent Consultation**
Agents can consult other specialists during task execution without switching personas:
```markdown
backend-architect: "I'm designing the authentication system..."
[CONSULT] web-security-specialist: "Implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, use JWT with short expiry"
backend-architect: "Excellent, incorporating these security measures..."
```

**Common Consultation Patterns:**
- **Security Reviews**: Any agent can consult `@web-security-specialist`
- **Code Quality**: All agents consult `@code-reviewer` for best practices
- **Performance**: Technical agents consult `@web-performance-specialist`
- **Research**: Any agent can consult `@web-search-specialist` for market data
- **Design**: Frontend agents consult `@ui-ux-designer` for UX decisions

### **Agent Development Guidelines**
- Each agent must have a distinct, non-overlapping specialty
- Follow the workspace management protocol
- Include comprehensive expertise descriptions
- Maintain professional tone and deep technical knowledge
- Use **`@auto-agent-generator`** for creating new agents to ensure consistency and proper integration
